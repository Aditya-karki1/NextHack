# Authentication Issue Fix Summary

## üîß Problem Identified
You were getting an "Authentication Error: Your session has expired" toast because there was a mismatch between authentication methods:

- **Frontend**: Was trying to use JWT tokens from localStorage 
- **Backend**: Was expecting JWT tokens from cookies
- **AuthContext**: Was correctly using cookies for login

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. **Updated CorporatePortal.tsx**
- Changed all API calls from using `Authorization: Bearer ${token}` headers to `withCredentials: true`
- Updated the following functions:
  - `fetchAllUserData()` 
  - `submitVerification()`
  - Legacy `fetchCredits()` 
  - Credit purchase refresh logic

### 2. **Added Debug Features**
- Added console logging to see user object structure
- Added "Debug User" button to inspect user data
- Enhanced error logging to show actual backend error messages

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Simplified error handling to show actual backend error messages
- Added detailed console logging for debugging

## üß™ Testing Instructions

1. **Start both servers:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Backend
   cd server
   npm start
   
   # Terminal 2: Frontend  
   cd shadcn-ui
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the login flow:**
   - Go to the corporate login page
   - Login with your company credentials
   - Check browser console for login response logs
   - Click "Debug User" button to see user object structure

3. **Test data fetching:**
   - Click "Load All Data" button in Corporate Portal
   - Check browser console for error details if any
   - Look for the specific error message in the toast

4. **Check browser cookies:**
   - Open Developer Tools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Cookies
   - Look for `token` cookie from `localhost:4000`
   - Verify it exists and has a value

## üîç Key Backend Configuration Confirmed

- ‚úÖ CORS configured with `credentials: true`
- ‚úÖ Cookie parser middleware enabled
- ‚úÖ Auth middleware checks both cookies and headers: `req.cookies.token || req.body.token || authHeader`
- ‚úÖ Login endpoint sets JWT as httpOnly cookie
- ‚úÖ Company model has correct role: "Comp"

## üö® If Still Getting Errors

1. **Check console logs** - They'll now show the exact error from backend
2. **Verify user object** - Click "Debug User" button to see if `_id` field exists
3. **Check network tab** - Look at the actual API requests and responses
4. **Verify cookie** - Make sure the token cookie is being sent with requests

The authentication should now work correctly since we've aligned the frontend to use the same cookie-based authentication that the backend expects!

## üéØ Next Steps

Once the authentication is working:
- Remove debug console logs
- Re-enable proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Test all features: profile fetching, verification, portfolio management
