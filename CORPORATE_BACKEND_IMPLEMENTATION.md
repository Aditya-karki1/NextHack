## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication & Security
```javascript
// All endpoints protected with JWT auth middleware
router.get("/profile/:companyId", auth, async (req, res) => {
  // Validates JWT token and user session
  // Excludes sensitive fields like passwords
```

### Data Validation
```javascript
// MongoDB ObjectId validation
if (!mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid(companyId)) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    success: false,
    message: "Invalid company ID"
  });
}
```

### One-Time Verification Logic
```javascript
// Check if already verified
if (company.kycStatus === 'VERIFIED') {
  return res.status(400).json({
    success: false,
    message: "Company is already verified"
  });
}
```

### Portfolio Analytics
```javascript
// Calculates comprehensive portfolio metrics
const portfolioData = {
  purchased: mapNgoDetails(purchased),
  retired: mapNgoDetails(retired), 
  totalSpent,
  carbonReduction: retired.reduce((sum, credit) => sum + credit.amount, 0),
  availableCredits: company.credits?.balance || 0
};
```

## 📊 Database Schema Usage

### Company Model Fields Used
- `kycStatus`: ['PENDING', 'VERIFIED', 'REJECTED']
- `organization`: Embedded document with name, type, address, contact
- `credits`: Balance and wallet information
